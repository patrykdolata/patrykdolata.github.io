        <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
        <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls
          without the use of ropes or harnesses.</p>
        <p>Unlike <a href="getting-started-page.html">traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but
          intensive
          routes called "problems," typically
          keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.
