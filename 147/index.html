      <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
      <p>Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls
        without the use of ropes or harnesses.</p>
      <p>Unlike traditional climbing, bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically
        keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.</p>
      <p>Experience the perfect blend of physical challenge and mental puzzle-solving as you navigate routes close to
        the ground, with nothing but a crash pad and determination. Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form,
        making it both accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts.</p>
